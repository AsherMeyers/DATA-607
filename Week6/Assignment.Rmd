First, let's install tidyr and load its library, as well as knitr.
> install.packages("tidyr")

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(tidyr)
```

Let's load the data

```{r}
untidy <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AsherMeyers/DATA-607/master/Week6CSV.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(untidy) <- c("Airline", "Status", "LA", "Phoenix", "SD", "SF", "Seattle")
View(untidy)
```

Let's remove the third, blank row and then transpose the data so it's easier to work with.
```{r}
tuntidy <- t(untidy[-3,])
kable(tuntidy)
```


Let's separate the dataframe into two dataframes, one for each airline.
```{r}
Alaska <- data.frame(tuntidy[c(-1:-2),1:2])
names(Alaska) <- c("OnTime", "Delayed")
West <- data.frame(tuntidy[-1:-2,3:4])
names(West) <- c("OnTime", "Delayed")
View(Alaska)
View(West)
```


```{r}

```
